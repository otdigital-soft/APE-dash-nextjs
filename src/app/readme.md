# App Folder Structure

* su: Super Admin dashboard
* (client): is for landing page & each invitation link (eg: loveletter.id/aldy-tita)
* dashboard: is for client dashboard

## Good to know

su (Super Admin) will uses antd for ui framework, to make it easier to develop since it's the access for developer or high-ranked admin only.
meanwhile the rest of it will use unocss with tailwindcss preset to make it flexible.
